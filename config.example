# Available colors:
# black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white
# bright_black, bright_red, bright_green, bright_yellow
# bright_blue, bright_magenta, bright_cyan, bright_white

# Color for directories
directory = "blue"

# Color for executable files
executable = "green"

[display]
# Number of spaces between columns (default: 2)
column_spacing = 2

# Maximum number of rows to display before wrapping to next column
# Only applies to short format (not -l). Set to 0 for no limit (default: 0)
# Note that this can look weird if you have a lot of files in a directory with
a small max_rows value. I think 8 is a pretty safe balance.

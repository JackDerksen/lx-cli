# Example configuration file for lx
# Place this file at: ~/.config/lx/config

[colors]
# Available colors:
# black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white
# bright_black, bright_red, bright_green, bright_yellow
# bright_blue, bright_magenta, bright_cyan, bright_white

# Color for directories
directory = "blue"

# Color for executable files
executable = "green"

# Color for regular files
regular = "white"

[icons]
# Custom icons for different file types
# By default, lx uses nerd font icons. If you don't have a nerd font installed,
# you can set custom icons here using any unicode characters or simple ASCII.

# Examples:
# Nerd font (default):
# directory = ""
# executable = ""
# regular = ""

# Emoji icons:
# directory = "📁"
# executable = "⚙️"
# regular = "📄"

# Simple ASCII:
# directory = "/"
# executable = "*"
# regular = "-"

directory = ""
executable = ""
regular = ""

[icons.colors]
# Custom colors for icons (separate from filename colors)
# Uses the same color names as [colors] section
# By default, icon colors match the filename colors for each file type
directory = "blue"
executable = "green"
regular = "white"

[display]
# Number of spaces between columns (default: 2)
column_spacing = 2

# Maximum number of rows before wrapping to next column in short format
# Only applies to short format (not -l). Set to 0 for no limit (default: 0)
max_rows = 0

[display.tree]
# Tree display style for recursive output (-r flag)
# Options: "ascii" (default) or "indent"
# - "ascii": Uses box-drawing characters (├──, └──, │)
# - "indent": Uses simple spacing for indentation
style = "ascii"

# Recursive long format style (when using -r and -l flags together)
# Options: "nested" (default) or "header"
# - "nested": Shows subdirectories indented under their parent directory in the same output
# - "header": Shows each directory as a separate section with the path as a header
recursive_long_format = "nested"

# Long format field ordering and visibility (used with -l flag)
# Specify which fields to display and in what order. Available fields:
# - filename: The name of the file
# - icon: The file icon
# - permissions: File permissions (e.g., drwxr-xr-x)
# - nlink: Number of hard links
# - owner: File owner name
# - group: File group name
# - size: File size (human-readable)
# - modified: Last modified date and time
#
# Default order (most readable with nested recursive output):
# [filename, icon, size, modified, owner, group, nlink, permissions]
#
# To customize, list the fields you want in your desired order:
long_format_fields = [
    "filename",
    "icon",
    "size",
    "modified",
    "owner",
    "group",
    "nlink",
    "permissions",
]
